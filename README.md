Explanation of Key Steps
Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler for models sensitive to feature magnitudes.
Algorithms:
Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary classification problems.
Decision Tree: A non-parametric model that works well with non-linear relationships.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better generalization.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the hyperplane to maximize class separation.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple algorithm that classifies based on nearest neighbors.
Model Comparison:
Accuracy scores are calculated for each model.
The best and worst models are identified based on accuracy.
